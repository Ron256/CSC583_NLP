Assignment project 3 focussed on text processing where I used Python - Sentiment Analysis using Afin 
and Vader packages to extract the different features (8 in total ), normalizing the values of each 
feature. After preprocessing the data, we split the dataset into train and test sets, which were fed 
into a logistic regression model to classify the documents into positive and negative reviews. 
Logistic regression model being a determinative model that separates the two classes was the  right 
algorithm to use, but it complicates the decision surface. 

Assignment Project 4 focussed on language models where I used the movie reviews data to build bigram, 
trigram and quadgram language models from scratch, from the positive reviews and negative reviews in 
the training set separately. Then evaluated the language models built with the reviews in the test 
set. The last part of this project was generate text from n gram language models.
