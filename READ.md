Assignment project 3 focussed on text processing where I used Python - Sentiment Analysis using Afin 
and Vader packages to extract the different features (8 in total ), normalizing the values of each 
feature. After preprocessing the data, we split the dataset into train and test sets, which were fed 
into a logistic regression model to classify the documents into positive and negative reviews. 
Logistic regression model being a determinative model that separates the two classes was the  right 
algorithm to use, but it complicates the decision surface. 

Assignment Project 4 focussed on language models where I used the movie reviews data to build bigram, 
trigram and quadgram language models from scratch, from the positive reviews and negative reviews in 
the training set separately. Then evaluated the language models built with the reviews in the test 
set. The last part of this project was generate text from n gram language models.

Assignment Project 5 focussed on Vector Semantics where I used Cosine similarity to find the most similar word to each of the given words then used vector addition and subtraction to compute the 
target words for the given analogies and the last part focussed on Word Embeddings specifically implementing the Continuous Bag of Words algorithm in Word2Vec using PyTorch.


Assignment Project 6 focussed on HuggingFace Exploration: I used the pipeline syntax to generate text, then Tokenizer and Model syntax to generate text and evaluated the pretrained language models 
by computing perplexity.
