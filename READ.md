Assignment Project 1 focussed on text processing where I used Python - Sentiment Analysis using Afin 
and Vader packages to extract the different features (8 in total ), normalizing the values of each 
feature. After preprocessing the data, we split the dataset into train and test sets, which were fed 
into a logistic regression model to classify the documents into positive and negative reviews. 
Logistic regression model being a discriminative model that separates the two classes was the right 
algorithm to use, but it complicates the decision surface.
